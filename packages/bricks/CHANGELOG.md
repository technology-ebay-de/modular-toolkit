# Changelog

## 1.1.1 / 12 Nov 2018

* Bug fix – in some setups, the browser console showed error about a component changing state during render when 
  changing routes with React Router. This was caused by the `withBricks` or `withBrick` HoC installing the same
  bricks multiple times. This was fixed.
* Fixed vulnerability from `merge` module found by npm audit

  (now correctly returns null)

* Added [useBrick](src/useBrick.js) and [useBricks](src/useBricks.js) React hook function that allow to add one
